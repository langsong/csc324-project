# README

This site is my individual project for Software Design and Development class at Grinnell College. During the development process, I developed and used various webpage development skills. I learned how to program using Ruby on Rails, and I used several developing techniques including creating static pages, adding dynamic features, and creating forms. I also learned how to create and manage database in order to create the user database for the website. Furthermore, I practiced software design habits of writing test suits for static page models and keeping consistent header and footer throughout the site. 

# Ruby on Rails Tutorial sample application

This is the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](https://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

## License

All source code in the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/)

[LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for details.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
